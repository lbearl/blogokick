<p>So, I have been dealing with a really persistent issue with a client at work lately, namely, they can't install a rollout that I did for them!  Obviously, this isn't good.  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the install works perfectly on their pre-production test instances, but when they go to install in production, it isn't working (which is doubly bad). The rollout install log showed one very obvious issue: javac was not able to be found, and one much more subtle issue: /usr/bin/build-classpath was unable to find xml-commons-apis.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="the-cause">The Cause</h2>
<p>The cause of this was found to be, due to the fact that the JAVA_HOME environment variable was pointing to the JRE instead of the JDK.  What I believe happened here is that the JDK provides a number of libraries in order to allow java files to be compiled to bytecode, while the JRE only needs to provide the foundation to run Java.</p>]]></content>
