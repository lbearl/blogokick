#Hello
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, I figure it is about time that I start a new blog detailing my life, the technology I use, and my ideas about a wide array of things.  In this blog I hope to discuss technology, challenges that I have faced in technology (and the solutions I found to those problems), and anything else that happens to come to mind.  My picture for this blog (and the domain as a whole) is to be a chronicle of my professional experiences, interlaced with a dash of my personality.

To that end, it should be noted that I am a fairly avid Linux user, who is currently making the transition to OS X, so I will probably discuss a fair amount of detail on the LAMP stack, in addition to related technologies.  I do love python, but have been thinking about doing my next project in ruby on rails due to how much noise that software has generated. As I flesh out this blog, I will be adding more details about projects I have worked on in the past, and possibly some speculation about the projects I would like to do in the future.

# Update 
I have migrated the blog from wordpress to blogofile so that I can remove all of the cruft that wordpress brings with it.  Instead now everything is just compiled markdown files and python Mako templates.
