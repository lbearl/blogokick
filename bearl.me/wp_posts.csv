Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:\
\
<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>\
\
...or something like this:\
\
<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickies to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>\

Overall, I am pretty impressed by how easy this entire process has been, the only major hiccup I had was accidentally calling the function which generates the full path + archive name as the name of the archive that Dropbox is supposed to store (for some reason Dropbox blew up a little bit when I wanted it to create /Users/lbearl/.../projects/mysqlbak without requesting any directories be created).\

After I finish up the code (and clean it up a lot), and do some basic refactoring (like removing the app secret), I will probably publish the code to Github.
